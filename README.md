This is the repository for all user contributed stuff

* contrib/tools/ is for 3rd-party tools. It usually serves as an incubator of trunk/contrib.
* contrib/plugins/ is for 3rd-party plugins. It will serve as the backend of exchange.munin-monitoring.org when it is operational again.
* contrib/templates/ is for 3rd-party templates. Feel free to update templates, or even to create new ones. Bonus points for mobile-friendly ones :)
